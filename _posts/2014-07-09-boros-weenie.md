A dech tech for my twist on a Standard Weenie deck.

Recently, the only deck I enjoyed playing in Standard was a White Weenie
list which ran almost all the available and efficient one-drops in
Standard, in addition to a few disruptive 2-drops like Azorius Arrestor
and Imposing Sovereign. The aim of the deck was to fill the board with
weenies, go for beatdowns until your opponent was around 10 life, then
cast Brave the Elements, naming the color of their blockers, and attack
for lethal.

The deck came very unexpectedly to my LGS's meta and grabbed quite a few
FNM's before the mono-black players started to splash green for
Golgari Charm and the American control players would add Anger of the
Gods to their package of wrath effects. It got to the point where most
of my matchups relied on drawing into Brave the Elements or an anthem
effect in game 2 and 3 to win.

Then a mono-red sligh list, made popular by Tom Ross, started to bloom
as a tier deck in my LGS's meta. Several inexperienced limited players
had picked the deck and began playing Standard due to the price. My
White Weenie deck had a very even matchup against them, other than one
card: Legion Loyalist.

Essentially, if they resolve the Loyalist with two other attackers, then
their attacks become devastating to block or slow down. So I sought after
a way to include the Loyalist in the deck, and here I am. However, a
different card is what made the deck really tick, Boros Charm.

Anyways, here is the list:

Weenies:

* 4 Boros Elite
* 4 Dryad Militant
* 4 Loyal Pegasus
* 4 Soldier of the Pantheon
* 4 Legion Loyalist
* 3 Daring Skyjek
* 2 Imposing Sovereign

Protection spells:

* 4 Boros Charm
* 4 Brave the Elements
* 1 Spear of Heliod
* 1 Hall of Triumph

Removal:

* 1 Banisher Priest
* 2 Banishing Light

Lands:

* 4 Mana Confluence
* 4 Sacred Foundry
* 2 Temple of Triumph
* 1 Mountain
* 11 Plains

Sideboard:

* 4 Celestial Flare
* 2 Banishing Light
* 2 Banisher Priest
* 2 Reprisal
* 2 Pithing Needle
* 2 Path of Bravery
* 1 Spark Trooper

## Weenies

Like your typical weenie deck, there is a lot of redundancy involved
in your creature-base. Dryad Militant and Soldier of the Pantheon are
your ideal turn-one plays, followed by a combination of Legion
Loyalist, Boros Elite or Loyal Pegasus is a very good curve. Like I've
said, the Loyalist is very crucial in fighting opposing Weenie decks
and making it very hard for your opponent to block effectively in the
early game. Additionally, Imposing Sovereign can be amazing to curve
out with in certain matchups, but in others is awful. Daring Skyjek
is there to win the mid-game battles where you need the evasion.

## Protection

One of the corner-stones in the deck is Brave the Elements. It is the
strongest card in the deck by far and is what gives it the reach it
needs. It is incredibly diverse, you can use this to stop removal, 
efficiently trade for creatures during combat, or giving your creatures
evasion to attack for lethal.

The second reason we are splashing red is for Boros Charm. In many
cases it can function similarly to Brave the Elements when it comes to
being a blowout combat trick and protecting your dudes from removal.
A huge plus is that it protects the deck from Supreme Verdict by
allowing us to have four Rootborn Defenses in the mainboard. As an
added bonus, it finished off our opponents in several situations.
There have been too many times where my opponent allowed themselves
to go down to 4 or lower after a big swing because they could win the
next turn or deal with my threats and was caught completely off-guard
with this.

The only good anthems in Standard right now are Hall of Triumph and
Spear of Heliod, which are both legendary. So we run one of each.
They are our only out to Golgari Charm and Doomwake Giant.

## Removal

In this case we are lighter than usual on the amount of disruptive
removal. Before I added Boros Charm, I had tested with Pacifisms which
worked very well, but now I cannot find a good spot for them outside
of cutting a Daring Skyjek or two(which have amazing synergy with the
Loyalist). Banisher Priest and Banishing Light are our only mainboard
outs to a lot of situations in the mid-game(which we never really want
to go to). When you are playing against midrange or control decks, be
very careful as to what you choose to use these on. Of course, we have
several more options available to us post-board.

## Sideboarding

Celestial Flare is our only out against Blood Baron of Vizkopa and
Stormbreath Dragon, additionally in a lot of creature-based matchups
they work very well in removing key blockers in the early game. Also
a little-known trick if there are two attackers or blockers is to wait
until after combat damage when you have traded for the other, and then
during the end-of-combat phase you can use these while the creatures
are still considered "attacking" or "blocking" creatures.

The Banisher Priests, Banishing Lights and Reprisals are here for
more redundancy against creature-based midrange decks like monoblack.
Essentially post-board this can become a mid-range weenie deck by
replacing all of the hyper-aggro weenies for more and more removal
spells.

Pithing Needles are here for any odd decks you might be matched up
with. Perhaps you can name AEtherling or Elspeth or Elixir against
control, and maybe name the Maze or something. You never know dude.

I'm not completely sure if I want Path of Bravery, because of the
life-gain effect, or Legion's Initiative because of the cost in this
slot. Either of them will do fine. I guess Path of Bravery is better
against mono-black and Legion's Initiative is better against opposing
aggro decks.

The final slot in the sideboard is Spark Trooper. You can put whatever
you want here, I just thought the trooper would be fun but I haven't
ever actually cast it in a match so I couldn't say much.
