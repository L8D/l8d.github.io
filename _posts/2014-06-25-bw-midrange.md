Ever since I got into MtG, I've always loved White. It seemed like an ideal
color with many answers and options of disruption. It had cards like
[Leyline of Sanctity](http://magiccards.info/query?q=leyline+of+sanctity),
[Disenchant](http://magiccards.info/query?q=disenchant) and
[Swords to Plowshares](http://magiccards.info/query?q=swords+to+plowshares),
which the rest of the color pie didn't have access to or didn't do as well.

Anywho, since I've loved playing midrange decks with white in them. I've become
particularly fond with the meta of modern and an assortment of the sideboard
seen in this deck. Otherwise, here is a quick rundown of the deck.

Essentially the deck has 10 hand disruption cards for first two turns.
[Thoughtseize](http://magiccards.info/query?q=thoughtseize) and
[Inquisition of Kozilek](http://magiccards.info/query?q=inquisition+of+kozilek)
are the only turn one plays of the deck, and there are only 6 of them. Don't be
too worried to let lands enter tapped and allow you mana base to develop.
[Tidehollow Sculler](http://magiccards.info/query?q=tidehollow+sculler) is our
four additional hand-disrupting effects. Usually with the Sculler you want to
take whatever will kill the sculler or a combo piece, or a counter spell for
your later plays.

In addition to hand disruption, we have a removal package too.
[Path to Exile](http://magiccards.info/query?q=path+to+exile) is one of the
best removal spells in the format, use it wisely. On top of that we have black
to give us 3 or 4 of either
[Doom Blade](http://magiccards.info/query?q=doom+blade) or
[Go for the Throat](http://magiccards.info/query?q=go+for+the+throat) depending
on the meta.

These two packages allow the deck to lock out or down your opponents for enough
turns to set up a game plan to win. That's the point of a midrange deck, to be
versatile and able to beat different matchups. We want to have the option of
being aggressive and going for a combo kill, while also having the option of
locking down our opponent's combo or aggro strategy.

Essentially the combo-ish part of the deck comes down to the swords. They are
game-winning in the hands of a
[Mirran Crusader](http://magiccards.info/query?q=mirran+crusader), but allow us
to turn our small utility creatures into hard-to-kill beatdown machines when we
need to be aggressive.

And that takes us to the creature base. The Bob and Sculler are there for
ovious reasons, but the Brimaz and Crusader are there to be used as creatures.
The protection from green in Mirran Crusader allows this deck to fight off
[Tarmogoyfs](http://magiccards.info/query?q=tarmogoyf) and
[Wild Nacatls](http://magiccards.info/query?q=wild+nacatl) amazingly.
Otherwise, like I said before, when he picks up a sword he has protection from
four colors, hits for eight, and gets *two* combat damage triggers.

Originally, the deck would run a playset of the Crusader and then complete the
package with
[Hero of Bladehold](http://magiccards.info/query?q=hero+of+bladehold) as a
two-of. Once Brimaz was released, I found him to better fit the role of Hero,
which was to be an 4-toughness blocker that can close out a game when need-be.

## Value Cards

[Dark Confidant](http://magiccards.info/query?q=lightning+bolt) is one of the
few reasons to be playing black in modern these days. Nothing in the mainboard
cost more than three, but you usually only want to draw 2-3 cards off of him
before he eats a [Lightning Bolt](http://magiccards.info/query?q=lightning+bolt)
or you just chump with him.

[Lingering Souls](http://magiccards.info/query?q=lingering+souls) is a very
high value card. It also is the only source of flyers in the deck. Because you
get to cast it twice, you can use it to push through a clog of counter spells.
It's not terrible to throw a sword on a token either.

[Zealous Persecution](http://magiccards.info/query?q=zealous+persecution) is a
very interesting card. In my opinion it is highly underrated but has seen play
in BW token decks. When used efficiently as a combat trick, it becomes a
single-sided wrath. Other times you can get free wins with it against decks
like Affinity. This is a card that is easy to learn but hard to master. It also
has plenty of synergy with Lingering Souls, Mirran Crusader and even Brimaz.

One last card I want to touch on here is
[Vault of the Archangel](http://magiccards.info/query?q=vault+of+the+archangel).
Like Zealous Persecution, I feel like this is an underrated card. In this deck
it is very powerful. Other than one of the swords, it is the only source of
life-gain in a deck with Bob, Thoughtseize and fetch lands. Use it to get a ton
of value out of Lingering Souls, or use it to stabilize and death-strike combo
with Mirran Crusader. Once you get to the late game where each player is top
decking their lands, it might as well read "Creatures you control have Lifelink
and can't be blocked."
