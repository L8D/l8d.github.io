      <p>
        Hello, I&rsquo;m a full-stack JavaScript developer that writes software
        to solve every problem you have from the start ranging from performance
        to SEO to isomorphism to scalability.
      </p>

      <p>
        I achieve this by following rigorous and disciplined coding practices
        similar to <a href="http://looprecur.com">Loop Recur</a>&rsquo;s
        approach to efficient software development. My go-to technologies are
        <a href="//backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a>,
        <a href="//expressjs.com">Express</a> and
        <a href="//purecss.io">Pure</a>.

        <h1>Node</h1>

        <p>
          Being a full-stack developer, my defacto platform for REST APIs,
          build systems or general network programming is Node.js. I&rsquo;ve
          also contributed several open source projects specifically for
          Node.js on
          <a style="color: #9b59b6" href="https://github.com/L8D">GitHub</a>.

      </li>

      <li style="background: #3498db">
        <h1>Backbone</h1>

        <p>
          Backbone is one of my favorite JavaScript application frameworks due
          to its lightweight functionality and lack of opinions. I won&rsquo;t
          use it everywhere, but I know it by heart and I am comfortable
          working with it.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li style="background: #8e44ad">
        <h1>React</h1>

        <p>
          React is one of, if not the best view engine on the market currently.
          It&rsquo;s isomorphic, functional, unopionated, modular and has
          incredible performance for what it is. If I&rsquo;m ever needing to
          build a complex UI, I will always consider React first.
        </p>

      <li style="background: #f1c40f">
        <h1>Angular</h1>

        <p>
          The catalyst of my manifesto, AngularJS is a framework that I personally despise. However, I have worked with it and know how to use it.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li style="background: #e74c3c">
        <h1>RxJS</h1>

        <p>
          RxJS (Reactive Extensions) is a set of libraries to support
          functional reactive programming in JavaScript. I prefer to use
          FRP libraries when I need to build scalable real-time apps that work
          with several event systems and sources.

        <p>
          &ldquo;Your product shouldn&rsquo;t be limited by the technologies
          you use.&rdquo;
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>The end user comes first</h2>

        <p>
          When making decisions over the architectures and technologies you
          use, always take into consideration how those will impact the end
          user. You prioritize the user&rsquo;s experience over that of the
          developer. That sacrifice, and how you compensate its implications,
          is what makes you the kind of developer you are.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Only use what you need</h2>

        <p>
          As part of your philosophy, you stand against the mainstream use of
          large, monolithic frameworks and you instead stand in favor of the
          modular application architecture.  This architecture gives you
          freedom in choosing what technologies you need. By design, your stack
          can now scale and compose with other technologies or
          architectures.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Correctness over ease of use</h2>

        <p>
          Rather than use technologies that are designed for the experience of
          the developer, you use libraries and frameworks that let you focus on
          writing correct, performant and scalable software. You write out
          every loop by hand. You focus on structuring your code for
          maintainability from the start. You adhere to a strict code-style
          that enforces readability and verbosity to accommodate for the lack
          of &lsquo;shorthand&rsquo; you can write.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Seperate your concerns</h2>

        <p>
          You do not depend on a single architecture or framework to decide how
          you separate your concerns. You make decisions on the needs of your
          product, not the needs of your technologies. You can choose how to
          structure your application because you use a modular architecture.
          You trust yourself and the developers in your team to make these
          decisions on a smaller scale.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Be aware of production</h2>

        <p>
          You are not a careless developer who does not worry about managing
          their production systems. You understand and control your production
          process. You make optimizations for your production environments. You
          structure your code to improve functionality in production. You know
          how to scale your production systems.
